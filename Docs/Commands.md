# Chat Commands

All Essentials commands live under the **`!ess`** prefix and are typed in the
global chat (or run from the server console). The host suppresses recognised
command lines from normal chat.

- `!ess` — overview of available commands.
- `!ess help` — list commands; `!ess help <command>` shows usage for one.
- `!help` — list every server command across all plugins.

**Arguments:** `<required>`, `[optional]`. Quote `"multi word"` values. Booleans
accept `true/false`, `yes/no`, `on/off`, `1/0`.

**Permissions** use Space Engineers promote levels, lowest to highest:
`None` < `Scripter` < `Moderator` < `SpaceMaster` < `Admin` < `Owner`. A caller
below a command's level does not see it in the overview. Commands without an
explicit level require **Admin**.

## Player & admin QoL

available; otherwise it falls back to private chat output.

## Entities & grids

Find, stop, delete and power-toggle entities, plus common grid administration.
`entities delete` and `grids static large` require running the same command again
within 30 seconds to confirm. `[gridName]` defaults to the grid the caller is
looking at where supported.

## Economy

`<player>` is a player name or identity id. `*` affects all players. `onlyOnline`
limits to online players; `excludeNpcs` (default `true`) skips NPC identities.
`eco deposit` and `eco withdraw` convert physical `SpaceCredit` items between
accessible inventories on the looked-at grid group and the caller's account.

## Ship fixer

Cuts and re-pastes a grid to clear physics/clang issues. Behaviour (cooldown,
confirmation window, projector handling, ejecting players) is governed by the
**Ship Fixer** config tab; the player `!ess fixship` command can be disabled
there.

| Command                      | Permission | Description                                               |

| `!ess fixshipmodid [gridId]` | Moderator  | Fix a grid by entity id.                                  |

## PCU & ownership

Inspect ownership/authorship and transfer PCU/ownership of a grid. `[gridName]`
defaults to the grid you are looking at. Transfers respect block limits unless a
`force…` variant is used. Player-facing claim/sale/rename workflows require the
caller to already own or have faction-share access to all owned functional blocks
in the target grid group.
